🌟 Task 4 Completed – ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd Internship 🌟

For Task 4, I developed a Beauty Products Filter & Sort Web App 💄 — a stylish, user-friendly catalog where users can explore, filter, and sort products by category, price, and rating.

💭 My goal was:

❓ “How can a product listing site feel both beautiful and functional?”

✨ “Can we create an elegant UI with pure frontend tools?”

✨ Features of the App:

🛍️ 20 popular beauty products across Skincare, Makeup, and Haircare

🎯 Category Filter – Instantly narrow results by type

📊 Sort By – Price (Low–High, High–Low), and Rating

⭐ Visual star ratings for user clarity

🎨 Beautiful UI with hover effects, shadows, and color-coded cards

📱 Fully Responsive Layout

🧠 Built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript only
